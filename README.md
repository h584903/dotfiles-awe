These are my personal dotfiles for my arch-linux computer.
I got tired of using the mouse when working so this laptop and these dotfiles are made with as many hotkeys as I want, so I never
have to take my hands of the keyboard.
The configurations I have here most indepth when it comes to NVIM and awesome window manager since these are the the two things that are the most customized, on the computer.

The end-goal of this project is to make a shellscript that I can start on installation of a new computer to completely install MY configuration of the programs that I want.
This means that if I had to loan a computer anywhere, since mine is unavailable for a good amount of time, I can still work in the enviroment that I fashioned for myself, and that I work the most efficently in.
